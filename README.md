My name is Simone, I’m 17 years old and I’m a developer with experience in developing websites and mobile application for small businesses and entrepreneurs.

My biggest passion is computer science, I love developing and make dreams of other people come true.

I’m attending the last year of high school and I’m about to take a degree in computer science.

I lived 6 months in England attending the Bexhill College, studying English, Economics, Business and Marketing so to use my business skills to realize the best possible product for your project.

For me, communication is the first thing to achieve a premium result.

With me, you will have the possibility to contact me whenever you want and I’ll be always disposable for a change in the project.
