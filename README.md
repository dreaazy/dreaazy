# About Me

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Simone, an 18-year-old with an insatiable hunger for knowledge and a strong affinity for technology and creativity. I'm a budding developer, specializing in crafting websites and mobile applications designed for small businesses and entrepreneurs.

## Background

Currently navigating the final year of high school, I'm eagerly anticipating the pursuit of a degree in computer science. My educational journey took a unique turn when I spent six months at Bexhill College in England, exploring subjects such as English, Economics, Business, and Marketing. This experience not only broadened my horizons but also equipped me with essential business skills to enhance the quality of the products I create for your projects.

## My Interests

Beyond the world of computer science, my passions include music, science, physics, and artificial intelligence. These diverse interests fuel my creativity and drive to explore innovative solutions. I thrive on the excitement that comes from constantly expanding my knowledge base.
